How to execute Matchmaker samples
=================================

Step 1: Go to root directory (SA-Matchmaker) and execute the following command
to create the 'lib' directory with all needed dependencies.

./create-sample-lib.sh

Step 2: Move into the 'build' directory of the sample you want to execute and 
run build.sh script to generate the matchmaker using the profile templates used 
in the sample.

Ex: 
cd samples/sample1/build
./build.sh

Step 3: Move into the root direcotry of the sample you want to execute and run 
the mm-sample.sh script by pointing to a given RO profile. Profiles are located 
inside 'sample-profiles' direcotry inside each sample.

Ex:
cd samples/sample1
./mm-sample.sh sample-profiles/ro.json

This will print the Matchmaker result generated by running the rules for the 
given RO against the sample repository and person profiles.
